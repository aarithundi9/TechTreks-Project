2025-11-03 02:41:34,investing,Portfolio Planning Advice - Roth IRA vs Brokerage,"Hey,

  
Planning to start investing soon because I got a job. This was my original plan and was wondering if this is good or if I should consider alternatives:

  
Currently I plan to invest 32,000 per year in stocks.

My plan was to put 70% of that money into ETFs (VOO, VTI, QQQ, SCHD, VYM) and put the other 30% into individual stocks of my choosing (NVDA, AMD, IBM, GOOG, RGTI?, IONQ?, or maybe other quantum computing or like nuclear energy companies still looking into it, but most of the money would be in big tech stuff). 

So that is 22400 in ETFs, and 9600 in individual stocks.

  
So I was thinking it would be better to max out my IRA (7k a year) and put all of that into individual stocks and then use a regular brokerage account for the remaining 2600 in individual stocks and 22400 for ETFs.

Also wondering how I should allocate between the dividend ETFs and the growth ones (like how much money should I put into stuff like VOO VTI QQQ vs SCHD and VYM)

2025-11-01 13:36:05,investing,Best instrument to express a bearish TSLA view,"I want to speculate on TSLA going down and wonder what the best financial instruments are.

**My belief**

* TSLA is overvalued. I want to bet on a price decline. (Yes, I know it’s a meme stock with a cult following.)
* I don’t have strong beliefs about the market/ other tech. GOOG’s PE was low, but is now more in line with big tech.

**Possible instruments and pros/ cons**

* **Put options on TSLA**

  * Pro: Defined risk
  * Con: Ongoing cost due to extrinsic value decay

* **Short TSLA stock**

  * Pro: Low ongoing cost (0.25% borrow fee)
  * Con: Unlimited downside

* **Inverse ETFs: TSLS (1x) or TSLQ (2x)**

  * Pro: Defined risk, simple to manage
  * Con: Potentially high ongoing cost due to volatility drag

**Current portfolio**

* Shorted TSLA stock.
* Invested proceeds into QQQ and GOOG (50/50), because they are (somewhat) correlated with TSLA and more realistically valued.

2025-10-27 05:20:33,investing,"AI is changing everything, But where are the real investment opportunities?","Having worked in tech and invested for several years, I wanted to share how I’m thinking about AI and opportunity.  
I’m from Singapore, now living in Silicon Valley as a tech enthusiast. I’ve always hoped I’d be one of the builders of the AI age. But lately it feels harder and harder to see where real opportunities are.  
When people talk about industrial revolutions, it’s always about inventors like James Watt or machines like the spinning jenny. But you almost never hear about the weavers who lost their jobs, even though, for example, around two-thirds of them were displaced during the first revolution.  
To me, AI feels a bit like that. It’s reshaping entire industries at a pace that’s hard to keep up with, and in many cases it seems to replace more roles than it creates. In some fields, it even reduces the need for human coordination altogether.a fintech CEO mentioned at the All-In Summit(AI and tokenization could broaden access to investing and early-stage opportunities, not just for big players.)  That got me wondering whether ordinary people today still have meaningful ways to take part in this wave of change, rather than just watch it unfold?  
I’ve been trying to balance between staying exposed to AI and not getting caught in the hype. Right now my portfolio is roughly 40% in broad index ETFs like VTI and QQQ, 25% in AI-related tech like NVDA, SMCI, and a bit of ARM, 20% in commodities and defensive sectors, and the rest in cash and some early-stage exposure through private investing platforms.

Feels like the market’s already pricing in a lot of AI optimism. Curious how others here are handling it. Are you adding to your AI plays, staying diversified, or just waiting for a pullback before doing anything?

(Not financial advice, just sharing thoughts.)

Edit:  
I really appreciated reading through all the comments, especially the ones about how people can actually get involved in the AI ecosystem instead of just observing it. Someone mentioned jarsy, so I looked into it a bit. From what I found, they use a one-to-one asset backed structure, where tokens correspond directly to real equity held in custody.

My knowledge of investing is fairly limited and high level as I just haven't had the time to really learn about investing.  I do not even know if the statement I made above makes any sense.

Most of my self-directed funds are in ETFs. It was explained to me that going this route has lesser fees than if I were to go through a plan offered by my administrator.  I do have investments in individual stocks as well (using my retirement plan)

Part of me is getting nervous about the stock market in general but I can't explain why since my understanding is surface level.  My self-directed portion has been pretty successful so far but so has the rest of my retirement that's manages through administrator.

I'm turning 40 next year so I have plenty of time left in my career.  Knowing me, I am not at the point where I am able to make really educated decisions on what ETFs or stocks to invest in.

Should I reallocate all my funds into the self-directed brokerage account and invest into different ETFs?  Should I move my funds that are in individual stocks into ETFs?  Or should I just stay the course?

2025-10-17 00:17:51,investing,QQQ Proxy Voting - my research & conclusions,"\[Cross-posted to r/ETFs\]

I just spent the past couple of hours researching this after being bombarded with an insane amount of mail from Invesco. It felt like that scene from Harry Potter where Hogwarts is trying to get in touch with Harry, except instead of being invited to attend a magical wizarding school I'm being told to proxy vote on three proposals for the future of my hard earned muggle money investments. Almost as fun...

I truly believe the one big positive from the Gamestop shitstorm was showing a large group of individuals organising and speaking as one makes an impact and can compete with the Goliath institutional investors. Below is more detailed rationale my votes. Proposals #2 and #3 are dependent on Proposal #1 passing (ie: if Proposal #1 to change the classification doesn't pass, the other two proposals don't matter regardless of how folks vote on them). If you voted already, don't worry - you can still amend your vote before October 23.



**TLDR: Invesco has the most to gain if Proposal 1 passes while we shareholders have a 2bps fee reduction to gain. I voted ""For"" on Proposal 1, voted individually on Trustees on Proposal 2, and voted ""Against"" for Proposal 3 to send a message to Invesco: Come back with a better deal for your shareholders if you want us to sign on. You clearly spent millions on outreaching us, obviously you want this deal. Don't insult us with 2bps chump change.**



**Voted ""For"" Proposal 1:** Changing QQQ's classification from a unit investment trust (“UIT”) to an open-end management investment company. Pro: Would reduce fees by 2bps. Con: Like others have already pointed out, why not more?  
I voted ""**For**"" on this because it would ultimately benefit us. But looking at the other large open-end large ETS their fees range from 3 to 9bps (exception being Russell's IWF at 18bps), so wtf is Invesco doing wasting our time and killing all these trees to come to us with a pitiful 2bps reduction to 18?! Seriously, I almost voted ""Against"" because it's so freaking insulting Invesco blew so much money on this campaign just to treat us like idiots.

source from Strategas Research Partners, 09/09/2025: [https://www.riskbridgeadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/qqq.png.webp](https://www.riskbridgeadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/qqq.png.webp)

**Voted Individually on Proposal 2:** Electing 9 individual Trustees to replace the current Trustee (a bank). Invesco auto-selected for us to vote ""For"" across the board. That really rubbed me the wrong way and I spent a good chunk of my time investing all the individual trustees to make my own selection. In a capitalist society, money is power and it's about dang time I use my hard earned muggle dollars to make however small an impact I possibly have. Below is how I selected for the Trustees, feel free to DM me for details or even better, research this yourself to make an informed decision:

Ronn R. Bagge: Withhold

Todd J. Barre: For

Brian Hartigan: For

Victoria J. Herget: For

Marc M. Kole: Withhold

Yung Bong Lim: For

Joanne Pace: For

Gary R. Wicker: For

Donald H. Wilson: Against

**Voted ""Against"" Proposal 3:** Invesco is proposing to serve as the Trust’s investment adviser. This for me is the kicker, if they want this to happen, come back to us with something better. I think this is how we can send the message ""Naw, don't insult us, work a little harder on this. Show us how much you want it."" I voted ""Against"" for Proposal 3 for all the reasons I explained above. I believe we shareholders can get a lot better deal and this is our chance to achieve it. If we blindly vote ""For"" on all three proposals, we've lost our voice and the Goliaths will have their chance to pull the strings behind the scenes while we get a pathetic 2bps reduction, which will be the **HIGHEST** fee of the large open-end ETFs.

I'm 45. AI will probably make my job obsolete in the next 5-10 years. 
I didn't rise above poverty until 2017. I make a modest income but it's not poverty anymore. I've only been saving and investing since then. 
I have ROTH IRA.
I also have VOO and SCHD (obviously it's been doing well since 2017). 
Main goal: don't be homeless when AI comes for my job.

I had a decent amount of extra money sitting in a safe Schwab managed account. When the market went down in the end of 2023 I got inspired and said fuck it, and put it all in on QQQ (I know QQQ has lots overlap with VOO but I wanted take a bigger swing). 

It's done well, it's doubled. But the AI bubble might burst sson and all the tech companies in QQQ crash. 

My instinct is to let it ride. I plan to not need it in the next 10 years.
I've thought that maybe I could sell the gains and put it in a safer investment, just play with the house's money.
Or sell ALL of it, maybe I'm overexposed to the S & P 500.

EDIT: I misspoke, I actually invested in November 2022! Not 2023 as the subject line of this post says. So as of today its a 117% gain. 

I loved reading all the responses. I think I'm going to hold it all and let it ride. I'm pretty conservative in most other investments, my Roth IRA is managed by Fidelity, a boring mix of bonds and diversified stocks, but it helps me sleep at night. 
It feels right to have an all-in big swing as well. Through a little risk and a lot of luck I successfully timed the market on the fastest growing industry. It might crash horribly or double again in 2 years (or both). I'll in it and see what happens.

2025-10-07 07:58:42,investing,TQQQ strategy sanity check,"I have been enamored with the idea of making a bunch of money by buying a major dip for a while now. However unless I have cash on hand to buy the dip that can’t really be done and to have cash on hand I’d have to risk missing out on returns now which may lead to less returns overall if a major dip doesn’t come soon. Big believer in the whole more money is lost hedging for a downturn than in the actual downturn. 

As an alternative to holding cash Iv been exploring holding leveraged funds during a downturn. Looking at charts of TQQQ it has had some enormous gains overall. Ik Ik it’s been an incredible bull run and that might not continue but not considering buying at highs and holding forever. Instead I was thinking something like at 10% draw back of QQQ shifting contributions to TQQQ which would make up a really small portion of my portfolio then every couple weeks re evaluate. If it continues to drop keep contributing to it. At say a 30% drop start shifting holdings to TQQQ and so on buying all the way down. 

As an exit strategy I would sell and put it back to normal allocations of S&P500 international, etc. once market returns to a new ATH or maybe just hold 1 more year. I’m aware of volatility decay and don’t want to go through 2 pullbacks that could lead to lower returns than the non leveraged index.

2025-10-05 13:35:56,investing,Did the math on ETF vs individual stock investing and the result was surprising,"Please feel free to pick apart my math because I didn't find a great formula for calculating the amount w/DRIP after 10 years to take into account average dividend growth rates as well, but it scarcely seems to matter when the [ETF #s get compared to individual stocks](https://imgur.com/a/Nh52dCb) over the same time period. Bare in mind, I did these calculations several months ago and added a couple on the back end that I was interested in for the sake of comparison, as you can see, but it didn't matter how I structured it. If you take the [most common top 10 holdings of well known ETFs ](https://imgur.com/a/c8T0APf)and diversify with just those 10 you should have beaten SPY and QQQ. The caveat being, of course, that no one had something like NVDA in their top 10 in 2015 but many of the other companies have been mainstays for >5 years. So you would have to occasionally rearrange your portfolio to accommodate the top 10 for your preferred investing style, but likely not by much.

The second thing I found interesting was [how ""dividend-focused"" ETFs performed ](https://imgur.com/a/DQwfR36)relative to those that are tracking specific indices or sectors. Despite having large holdings in ""growth"" companies that offer very low dividends, too. I think this reaffirmed my choice to use SCHD to hedge against market downturns but if I were 100% growth focused I wouldn't use that one either. I debate the strengths and weaknesses of dividend focused investing routinely, but I think the conclusion is that by the very nature of offering large dividends those companies are going to be growing more slowly. However, by common sense and the data, those companies tend to also be more stable during market corrections. So if you lean bearish then higher investment in those types of companies (not necessarily the ETFs) could still play to your favor.

Anyway, all critiques are welcome and if you can provide experience or data that contradicts my assumptions or highlights important points that I missed then please do.

2025-10-30 19:56:34,investing,"Apple Surges After Beating Q4 Expectations, Forecasts Record Holiday Quarter","Apple reignited investor confidence with a stronger-than-expected fiscal Q4, showcasing its resilience amid supply disruptions, tariffs, and heightened competition in China. The company reported revenue of $102.47 billion, topping Wall Street’s $102.19 billion estimate, while earnings per share of $1.85 beat expectations of $1.77.

iPhone revenue came in at $49.03 billion, slightly below the $50.19 billion forecast, due to delayed iPhone Air launches and regional headwinds, while Services revenue surged to a record $28.75 billion, driving margin expansion and offsetting hardware softness. CEO Tim Cook projected 10–12% growth in the December quarter, calling for the “best-ever holiday season” led by strong demand for the iPhone 17 lineup and ongoing Services momentum.

Apple’s Mac and Wearables divisions also outperformed, posting revenue of $8.73 billion and $9.01 billion, respectively. Despite a $1.1 billion tariff hit and an expected $1.4 billion impact next quarter, Apple declared a $0.26 dividend and reaffirmed its robust cash position. Following the results, shares rose nearly 5%, reclaiming roughly $320 billion in market value as investors shifted focus toward the company’s upbeat holiday outlook and AI-driven growth trajectory.

The company’s Q3 results shattered Wall Street expectations across advertising, cloud, and subscription lines powered by Gemini adoption, YouTube monetization, and a surge in enterprise AI workloads.

CEO Sundar Pichai unveiled new milestones that underline the company’s AI transformation: Gemini now processes over 7 billion tokens per minute, boasts 650 million monthly active users, and Google has surpassed 300 million paid subscriptions. Meanwhile, over 70% of Google Cloud clients now use AI-powered products, solidifying Alphabet’s position as both a data and compute powerhouse.

The company raised its FY2026 capex guidance to as high as $93 billion, with a “significant increase” in infrastructure spending planned to expand TPU capacity and custom AI chip production. Analysts now view Alphabet’s capital strategy as a direct response to rising competition from OpenAI, Meta, and Amazon defining an arms race where AI infrastructure, not advertising, drives the next trillion in value.

Most of the gains (30.68%) actually comes from multiple expansion, i.e. investors are willing to pay more for the same earnings. This usually happens when markets expects excelerated growth, and I think it is fair to assume that this is mostly fueled by the AI hype. You might think this is justified, but consider the case if the AI hype is just hype and we are 20-30 years away from the dreams of today.

This is not a doomsday post. Earnings can still improve and everything will turn out fine. But I think it is wise to say that we should at least de-risk a little.

If this were a doomsday post, I would argue that we WILL go to pre-AI valuations (PE=20-25), which would imply a decline of 35%, posibly much more as incentives shifts, and Nasdaq 100 would fall even more. The investments in AI data centers of 100’s of billions of dollars almost completely stop, and we would most likely see GDP contractions because of this, and likely recession - [Without data centers, GDP growth was 0.1% in the first half of 2025](https://fortune.com/2025/10/07/data-centers-gdp-growth-zero-first-half-2025-jason-furman-harvard-economist/?fbclid=IwY2xjawNm9u1leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETBxQkdSVGY3b01vNERpVXRnAR4G7C0X-Lk34PVBcsi76x41XKuMTJvnyQSYQW8fQW__uOS9vKs3fLVIcbvCeA_aem_P9AWgkxaseQP5ZjwBUCiQg).

Here's where I landed at this point. What do you think and what would you do differently? Any comment or criticism is highly appreciated!

* 25% U.S. Core - **RSP** Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF
* 25% U.S. Quality/Dividend - **SCHD** Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF
* 25% U.S. Growth - **QQQM** Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF
* 25% International - **IDEV** iShares Core MSCI International Developed Markets ETF

The 4-ETF portfolio is optimized for long-term holding by combining simplicity with a sophisticated, risk-balanced strategy. Using just four funds makes the portfolio easy to understand, implement, and rebalance, ensuring investors can stay the course over time.

Its effectiveness stems from three key design choices:

**1. Strategic Balance (The Barbell Approach)** The portfolio balances concentrated, aggressive growth (QQQM) against high-quality, defensive value stocks (SCHD). This ""barbell"" strategy allows the portfolio to capture significant upside when growth stocks rally, while remaining resilient during market volatility or when value factors are in favor.

**2. Smart Risk Management** The U.S. Core utilizes RSP (Equal-Weight S&P 500). This actively manages risk by preventing excessive concentration in the mega-cap technology stocks that already dominate QQQM. RSP provides genuine diversification across the entire U.S. market.

**3. Efficient Global Diversification** IDEV provides comprehensive, low-cost exposure to international developed markets. This offers essential geographic diversification, reducing reliance on the U.S. economy.

If you voted already, don't worry - you can still amend your vote before October 23.



**TLDR: Invesco has the most to gain if Proposal 1 passes while we shareholders have a 2bps fee reduction to gain. I voted ""For"" on Proposal 1, voted individually on Trustees on Proposal 2, and voted ""Against"" for Proposal 3 to send a message to Invesco: Come back with a better deal for your shareholders if you want us to sign on. You clearly spent millions on outreaching us, obviously you want this deal. Don't insult us with 2bps chump change.**



**Voted ""For"" Proposal 1:** Changing QQQ's classification from a unit investment trust (“UIT”) to an open-end management investment company. Pro: Would reduce fees by 2bps. Con: Like others have already pointed out, why not more?  
I voted ""**For**"" on this because it would ultimately benefit us. But looking at the other large open-end large ETS their fees range from 3 to 9bps (exception being Russell's IWF at 18bps), so wtf is Invesco doing wasting our time and killing all these trees to come to us with a pitiful 2bps reduction to 18?! Seriously, I almost voted ""Against"" because it's so freaking insulting Invesco blew so much money on this campaign just to treat us like idiots.

**Voted Individually on Proposal 2:** Electing 9 individual Trustees to replace the current Trustee (a bank). Invesco auto-selected for us to vote ""For"" across the board. That really rubbed me the wrong way and I spent a good chunk of my time investing all the individual trustees to make my own selection. In a capitalist society, money is power and it's about dang time I use my hard earned muggle dollars to make however small an impact I possibly have. Below is how I selected for the Trustees, feel free to DM me for details or even better, research this yourself to make an informed decision:

Ronn R. Bagge: Withhold

Todd J. Barre: For

Brian Hartigan: For

Victoria J. Herget: For

Marc M. Kole: Withhold

Yung Bong Lim: For

Joanne Pace: For

Gary R. Wicker: For

Donald H. Wilson: Against

**Voted ""Against"" Proposal 3:** Invesco is proposing to serve as the Trust’s investment adviser. This for me is the kicker, if they want this to happen, come back to us with something better. I think this is how we can send the message ""Naw, don't insult us, work a little harder on this. Show us how much you want it."" I voted ""Against"" for Proposal 3 for all the reasons I explained above. I believe we shareholders can get a lot better deal and this is our chance to achieve it. If we blindly vote ""For"" on all three proposals, we've lost our voice and the Goliaths will have their chance to pull the strings behind the scenes while we get a pathetic 2bps reduction, which will be the **HIGHEST** fee of the large open-end ETFs.

2025-10-30 10:32:57,stocks,Shorting Coverd Call ETFs and buying the underlying,"Hello Everyone,

I have recently been thinking about a strategy i have never heard someone else talk about before and would like some serious feedback on this one.

Most Coverd Call ETFs simply sell ATM Calls with 1 Month until expirarion. This caps there upside for premium and creates long term drag against the underlying.
Thus a coverd call ETF will in the long run basically always underperfom the underlying.

My idea:

After a major market crash, implied volatility spikes and these ETFs sell very rich calls struck near the new, lower price level. If the market then stabilizes or recovers, they severely underperform because their upside is capped for months while vol collapses.

The Trade:

Wait until after a sharp drawdown (say, −25–30 % and VIX > 35).

Short a covered-call ETF, for Example QYLD

Then go long on the underlying, like QQQ

Borrow cost would be around 1–2 % p.a., and I’d owe the monthly distributions.

So as Volatility mean-reverts and the market rebounds, the covered-call ETF lags badly, thus generating excess return on my long position.

What do you guys think about this?
I know there is no free money and im screwed if the underlying just continues to fall further, but i really think this is a sound idea.

TLDR

QQQ LEAPS: +$150k gain

QQQ shares: +$60k (unrealized)

XLP LEAPS: -$80k loss

NEW POSITIONS: $300k in VOO

Hi again. I'm sure like 5 people remember my last post from a year ago where I broke down my entire strategy. I won't be doing that again, but here's an update on how it performed. Overall up +32% which is slightly better than QQQ's +29%. I didn't even come close to TQQQ's +63% this time around and the cause is pretty clear...

XLP flopped big time. I know it's a hedge so in a way it's supposed to underperform when everything is at all time highs but to underperform THIS much? It felt like I was hedging my calls with puts. I could speculate that there's some global macroeconomic shift away from consumer staples or something but I didn't get here by doing that kind of DD. I just backtested historical returns.

https://preview.redd.it/8oih97uutgyf1.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=99e35321eff36d599934739ea8de4f8d9c0227c1

On an unrelated note, I find it hilarious that some haters bookmarked my post and showed up to say ""told you so"" around liberation day. Yeah I was down -$167k at the time but I've seen worse and that ended up being a nothing burger. Turns out when your calls have 1-2 years until expiry those temporary setbacks don't matter much.

Moving forward, I think I'm done with options. I'm sure we've all seen those posts where people hit it big and make life changing money but don't know when to quit. There's this dismissive attitude like ""if you can't quit your day job right this instant then it's not enough money"" but that's just not true. All time (since 2018) I'm up +$415k which is a massive head start and is plenty to snowball into retirement from here even in shares. Maybe if my goal were to hit a high score of millions of dollars I'd keep YOLOing 50% of my portfolio into LEAPS every year but I just want a comfy normal life.

If you backtest retirement strategies (which I've done a lot of) the ones that fail happen when you hit your target number due to some bubble, quit your job, then immediately stuff crashes back down like in 2000 or 2008. Moving to safer investments early and planning to work a while longer should both protect against that in case we're in a bubble right now.

It's been fun. We'll see if I have anything worth posting next year but probably not. The actually boring stuff starts now.

2025-11-02 11:42:00,wallstreetbets,Abaxx Technologies: Newest Clearing House and Exchange with Massive Upside,"This is gonna be a longish post. Potential for more than a 50x maybe even +100x but that's extremely hopeful. It has digital identity, digital assets, T+0 settlement, digital gold, tokenized stocks, exchange and clearinghouse.

The stock just hit 1 billion USD market cap so I can finally post about it here.

**TLDR:** 10x in 1-2 years, 50x within 5 years.

New high tech globally recognized and licensed clearinghouse/exchange that is integrating their new digital identity with digital title ownership that has legal finality. Basically merging better tech than CRCL ($30 billion MC) with better tech than CME ($95 billion MC) to unlock a 42 trillion dollar industry.

First you have to understand, that commodity clearinghouses and exchanges are worth ALOT of money. Here is all the publicly listed ones. Very few exist. Notice Abaxx at the bottom worth 1 billion.  


|Clearing|Parent Company|Stock Ticker|Market Capitalization (Nov 2025)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CME Clearing|CME Group Inc.|CME (NASDAQ)|\~$93 billion|
|LCH.Clearnet|London Stock Exchange Group plc (LSEG)|LSEG.L|\~$49 billion|
|ICE Clear (U.S., Europe, etc.)|Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE)|ICE|\~$83 billion|
|Hong Kong Securities Clearing|Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX)|[0388.HK](http://0388.HK)|\~$69 billion|
|Clearstream|Deutsche Börse AG|[DB1.DE](http://DB1.DE)|\~$47 billion|
|Abaxx Clearing|Abaxx Technologies Inc.|ABXX (NEO) / ABXXF (OTCQX)|\~$1 billion|



The problem lately is that the big ones have been ignoring industry requests for physically delivered contracts. Now they just launch financially settled contracts which are mostly products for traders not commodity companies which need physical delivery.

Also you have LBMA that trades metals like nickel. Remember when LBMA reversed nickel trades for a their Chinese trader because he was caught with his pants down?

So industry is ready for another exchange and a clearinghouse that will fix these issues. Many have come to Abaxx for this.

Now in comes Abaxx exchange and clearinghouse. Their focus has been physically delivered that are being requested by industry. They have launched LNG, Carbon, Nickel, Lithium, and Gold. LNG and Gold could easily be worth billions each. The others worth hundreds of millions. This is just what they launched so far. They plan to launch much more like weather derivatives likely to come this year still.

Abaxx LNG physically delivered contract is already set to replace the financially settled JKM LNG contract (which generates over 100+ million in revenue) as it is better in all aspects due to physically delivered nature.

I[n June JKM reported 128,000 lots traded. In November, Abaxx had 9,529 lots traded across its LNG contracts. So already 7.4% of the trading.](https://x.com/James_Duade/status/1984588708444598605) Not a equal comparison month comparison, but just a rough idea. All without US trading firms while Abaxx gets approval to support US clients (CFTC Approval expected after lockdown is over). They are regulated out of Singapore which the US already sees as equivalent, they just need the final sign off. As Abaxx volumes grows, traders will need to trade their LNG out of necessity. As it continues to grow, risk management will require Abaxx LNG physically delivered contracts, again out of necessity.

I suspect Abaxx will overtake JKM in 2026 and make it essentially worthless. Abaxx's LNG contracts alone will likely be worth 5-10 billion USD creating a pretty good safety buffer at a 5x from here.

Abaxx is also piloting tech with Minehub to let traders us LNG shipments on water as collateral in their futures exchange. This will be expanded out to all their futures markets on success and will also allow traders to use their gold as collateral with much better rates.

Their gold futures contract is also gaining traction. They are likely to launch gold spot this month as well with a similar system set up for silver next month. Maybe even this month as well.

For those unaware of the gold markets, New York is the futures market and London is the spot market. Which means traders have to physically ship gold bars in a plane to meet delivery. And the gold bars are different sizes (so need a smelter) and in different legal jurisdictions.

Abaxx Gold market (and soon silver) will have futures and spot take delivery in the same location, same legal jurisdiction and same gold bar sizes which are also smaller and easier to trade. There is significant efficiencies here which will likely act as a liquidity blackhole for all precious metals markets.

**Digital Cheques**

Abaxx has announced the pilot launch of their own digital cheques for money market funds that transfer instantly. (I want to avoid that cursed word stable coin because Abaxx has nothing to do with that industry). But Abaxx's tech is better. It’s completely private with legal finality. For those bullish on Circle/Tokenization, just know that banks and companies are never gonna adopt stablecoins on a public ledger that can be all tracked by your favourite three letter agency or competitors. Don't get be even started on counterparty risk of those products. It is a product for retail only.

Abaxx exchange and clearing house was built from the ground up with this technology integrated into the exchange. Which means they will use it for instant money transfers and instant T+0 settlement. I can’t emphasize enough what T+0 settlement means for liquidity and trading. It also unlocks the ability for LNG traders to collateralize their trades with gold for example. Nothing more annoying than wanting to trade something but you have to wait several business days for funds to clear or pay interest to get immediate access.

The same technology they are also planning to bring to stocks allowing for instant settlement and trading. And if you are paying attention, it’s connected to a regulated clearinghouse and exchange. One of the most regulated customers they will ever have. When they eventually launch a currency trading platform, you can have instant international wire transfers that are routed through a currency exchange to get the current exchange rate and have it instantly settle. None of these $50 wire transfers with awful exchange rates that takes 3 days to arrive in your account.

I would dare to say they are building the entire ecosystem needed to bypass the swift network. Think of it like an Apple ecosystem. You use swift to get into it by wiring money to their custodians ([which Abaxx also launched and is using it for their carbon markets](https://x.com/JoshCrumb/status/1964042716083364164) ), but once inside, you have access to instant money transfers, clearinghouse and exchange, stock markets, commodities, and forex. So Abaxx is building the Apple equivalent for the global financial system.

Abaxx will also be focusing on bringing 42 Trillion worth of MMFs and Gold to the digital world next year while taking 5 basis points ($21 billion revenue potential) to do so yearly as well as some transaction fees. Obviously they won't get everything. But several of their partners and investors manage already trillions of MMF and appear to like the product. [Their investors control +50% of the MMF funds in USA.](https://x.com/JosephTMetcalf/status/1973059584915898697)

**Digital Identity**

Okay so behind all their is their ID++ which is their digital identity. It’s all private and encrypted and you use it with the exchange. The Exchange will perform KYC on you and issue credentials. These credentials you use to sign your trades and money transfers. It’s built in a way that you can grant access to portions of it as needed. If you need to sign up for a platform thats needs to KYC you, you grant access to only a certain portion your digital identity on a limited basis. Then you can revoke their access and no longer have access to your documents so you don’t have to be exposed to data hacks on every platform you sign up on. It is built with all the latest digital identity standards like w3 but it's also self sovereign which means you control your identity and its not issued by a government entity. The end goal being is that governments would issue credentials independently to your id and create a ""chain"" of verified credentials. Universities as well for example would issue your grad certificates so you can verify it instantly if someone ever required. But you retain full control of it.

The point here isn't so much what it does though, but what it unlocks. Abaxx uses this for their clearing activities and is one of their secret sauces that helps them instantly clear their transactions.

**Graded Commodities**

Going back to the exchange, Abaxx will also be launching graded commodities. For example different levels of copper grading based on metadata which allows you track carbon emissions or anything else needed. Currently nothing like it exists and will be done through their Minehub partnership.

It would prevent electric car companies saying their technology is clean while importing cobalt that was mined from forced labour in Africa. With Abaxx you could get premiums on commodities that were mined cleanly and ethically.

Regulations for carbon emissions are also starting to pick up pace. Countries are introducing legislation requiring scope 3 emissions reporting (aka higher up the supply chain). Australia, Brazil, California, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, Europe, and USA are all introducing legislation that require commodity supply chain tracking for source of origin, forced labour monitoring, or carbon emissions.

This information is not available on current exchanges making them a black box. Abaxx will launch graded versions of these commodities that include metadata that tracks the commodity through its entire supply chain.

I could go on but I'll stop it here. I am already at \~4x since i have been buying this stock for a while and just averaging in the entire time. I think it could be $100 billion+ company but the reasoning why would require a second more in depth DD. I can do it if there is enough interest. But based what I said already i think $50 billion is a good limit. If I am right, I see no reason to ever sell this company so I will be holding indefinitely. You can only buy stock on CBOE in Canada, OTC in USA (Sorry robinhood users, get literally any other broker), and on Frankfurt exchange as well.

[Cantor just put a price target of $81 CAD on it](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/cantor-fitzgerald-initiates-abaxx-technologies-stock-with-overweight-rating-93CH-4318669). So industry backed 2x if you have less risk tolerance and don't quite yet see the vision. That price target only accounts for exchange angle and doesn't account for their tech which is significantly higher. This stock is forward looking and revenues are just now starting to pick up. Hence the recent surge in stock price.

[Here is a in depth video highlighting how it could be worth hundreds of billions. Video is 1hr and 20 min long. ](https://youtu.be/go0bc0K4UdQ?si=LrN3VQdKGw0wwdfW) He runs a family office and he works with the team as sort of a liaison trying to connect sellers with institutions wanting to buy in size so obviously a bit of bias. At the same time though, after having done lots of research myself, you will start to realize that the exchange and clearinghouse (worth tens of billions on its own) is actually just one portion of what they are trying to build. Hence my example of the Apple like ecosystem.

Will answer any questions as best I can.

2025-10-27 14:22:41,wallstreetbets,NBIS earnings DD (Ne🅱️ius),"TLDR/summary: NBIS is going to skyrocket after upcoming q3 earnings due to multiple upcoming bullish catalysts as well as ANOTHER upwards revision in ARR guidance for full year 2025.

Positions: 8k worth of call options  with most expiring 11/21. $100, $110, and $130 strikes are the main position. Will likely be adding into further OTM strikes as well, probably $140 and $150 when other funds settle.

If you check my post history you will see a previously written speculation post on q3 earnings. This post will include a lot of the same information, with some extra. But positions have been rearranged to reflect real earnings date of 11/11 instead of 10/31 like I had originally thought. I did take a 3k loss due to this mistake earlier (that’s ok I’m fucking stupid)

Company overview

Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ: NBIS) is a European AI-infrastructure company based in Amsterdam with R&D hubs across Europe, Israel, and North America. Originally part of Yandex N.V., Nebius became its own pure-play “neo-cloud” infrastructure firm after spinning off all Russian assets in 2024.

Today, Nebius operates data center infrastructure and provides a full-stack AI cloud platform (“Nebius AI Cloud”) serving startups, research labs, and hyperscalers.

Nebius’s “platform as a service” (PaaS) adds another layer and acts as an alternative to the “infrastructure as a service”(IaaS) models that other Neo clouds use, such as IREN, CRWV, etc

Current CEO Arkady Volozh was co-founder of Yandex. Dig a little deeper into their spin off from Russia and you will understand how talented the Nebius crew is today. They have plenty of experience in large scale cloud and AI systems experience. The only difference now is that they are starting with a clean slate, and access to western markets.
——————————————————————————

Earnings preview

[Q2 earnings](https://assets.nebius.com/assets/a1ea2731-32b4-4b8d-82b4-0557fddadd1a/Nebius%20-%20Financial%20results%20-%20Q2%202025.pdf?cache-buster=2025-08-26T16:52:29.128Z) was incredibly bullish for nebius, with an 2025 ARR guidance being revised upwards from 750m-1b to 900m-1.1b. Not only that, but they saw a 625% increase in revenue YoY. Q2 earnings were released on August 7, 2025.

As you can see from q2 earnings, they were already poised for explosive growth.

[Then, they went and signed a $17.4billion contract with MSFT](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1513845/000110465925088312/tm2525580d1_6k.htm) on September 8, 1 month after their q2 earnings call.

The important thing to remember about the MSFT deal is that this is not instant revenue for NBIS. NBIS must have activated capacity to service the contract prior to receiving revenue from this.

It is extremely unlikely that Nebius’ $900M–$1.1B ARR guidance (which was already revised up from previous) from Q2 earnings included money from the Microsoft deal. That guidance came out in August, while the contract wasn’t announced until september. Companies generally don’t build unfinished or undisclosed deals into official numbers.

Along with that information, please check their 6k (linked above) - “Gpu services will be deployed in several tranches during 2025 and 2026”, meaning that at least part of the revenue from MSFT contract will be baked into 2025 figures. 

Rumor has it that the MSFT contract encompasses 300mW of activated capacity. Nebius guided for 220mW of build out by EOY’25 and 1GW by EOY ‘26. This again indicates that Nebius is ready to start collecting revenue from said contract this year. 

Given that average ARR over the life of the MSFT contract is a little less than 4b/year, if they even capture 1/4 of that in 2025 they will be effectively doubling their previously projected ARR for ‘25

Side note, a deal of this size with one of the biggest hyperscalers shows confidence in Nebius product and Nebius cloud. More companies will likely follow provided they execute MSFT deal well.

——————————————————————————
Other tech earnings 

MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, META will be reporting earnings this week. I expect a lot of chatter regarding increased AI capex spend as well as increased need for more compute from these companies. This will run Nebius price up until they report earnings.

——————————————————————————

NVDA GTC partnership speculation.

NVDA has equity stake in Nebius. Nebius will be speaking at GTC, right after an NVDA announcement for a [partnership](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/dc/session-catalog/?search=DC51273&tab.allsessions=1700692987788001F1cG#/ ) regarding AI agents and full stack software offerings (sound familiar?) the whole Nebius executive team will be there and will be the first ones to speak at 9:40am after this announcement.

Nebius also teasing that they will be announcing something at GTC and to stay tuned.

——————————————————————————
Macro bull catalysts

- FOMC, rate cuts, a dovish Powell, and QT coming to an end.
- Chyna deal

Risks 

Macro risk
Tech earnings bad / ai capex spend decrease(doubt)

Execution risk (doubt, leadership is awesome)

2025-11-01 13:38:15,StockMarket,Best instrument to express a bearish TSLA view,"I want to speculate on TSLA going down and wonder what the best financial instruments are.

**My belief**

* TSLA is overvalued. I want to bet on a price decline. (Yes, I know it’s a meme stock with a cult following.)
* I don’t have strong beliefs about the market/ other tech. GOOG’s PE was low, but is now more in line with big tech.

**Possible instruments and pros/ cons**

* **Put options on TSLA**

  * Pro: Defined risk
  * Con: Ongoing cost due to extrinsic value decay

* **Short TSLA stock**

  * Pro: Low ongoing cost (0.25% borrow fee)
  * Con: Unlimited downside

* **Inverse ETFs: TSLS (1x) or TSLQ (2x)**

  * Pro: Defined risk, simple to manage
  * Con: Potentially high ongoing cost due to volatility drag

**Current portfolio**

* Shorted TSLA stock.
* Invested proceeds into QQQ and GOOG (50/50), because they are (somewhat) correlated with TSLA and more realistically valued.
* Majority of portfolio is long VT, which I rarely touch.

**Are there other or better ways to express a bearish TSLA view while balancing risk and cost?**",9,38,0.65,https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1oltwr0/best_instrument_to_express_a_bearish_tsla_view/,0.095,0.8,0.105,0.2886

This opportunistic tilt enables me to accumulate top S&P 500 stocks at relative discounts during weakness. I am expecting this strategy to deliver slightly better long-term returns than a passive VOO-only strategy, by systematically increasing cost basis efficiency in high-conviction names during dips.

2025-10-24 10:06:34,ETFs,Learned from my mistakes twice. Need some advice with some liquidity right now.,"I am new in the ETFs world and new also in the investment world. After reading a lot about the Boglehead concepts decided to invest this year in VTI 80% and 20% in QQQ. So far so good I am up 18% but recently for trying to beat the market last week decided to sold al my QQQ stocks and invest in URA, bought at USD 56 and then... URA went down like hell to 47 and lost USD 1100 because I got in panic and decided to sold my URA stocks and now got some USD 5k in cash in liquidity.

What should I do now? Invest all in VTI and chill all in lump sum fire and forget?? And then DCA every month??   
Learned from my mistakes I do not have the stomach to see my balance goes down 15-18% in 5 days, it is really hard for me to see a 5-7 consecutive days loosing 3%-4% each day.   
I totally prefer to go up a bit every week like 0,15% or 0.20% every week than gamble again in the market.

2025-10-23 10:55:17,ETFs,Rebalancing Portfolio While Considering Capital Gains,"I recognize this is a bit of a ""first-world"" problem but I've learned a lot from this forum and am curious on thoughts regarding the best approach. I need to keep $100k attached to my Bank of America account so I have most of that sitting in a Meryl Edge account. I initially started with SPY and then later added QQQ. Currently it's in 2:1 ratio. This is very much a sit and forget account since I need to keep the balance. I have $2m+ across other retirement and investment accounts so it's not my primary savings. 

While the account has obviously done well over the past couple years, I'm also thinking that it is too Large Cap heavy and if there's a correction it may get hit hard. If I were to do over (i.e., after reading more of this forum!), I would probably consider VT or a VTI/VXUS combo. Since I'm not going to add to this account my options would be to either stick with it as is or rebalance it and take the capital gains hit. My investment advisor suggests the former (at least for the rest of this year), but I'm curious on others thoughts.

So the question seems to be is: Capital Gains + VT (or some other rebalancing) > SPY/QQQ. From some other research, SPY has 0.94 correlation with VT and QQQ has 0.84 so it's possible that any expected difference between SPY+QQQ and VT is not enough to really be over-thinking this.",2,3,0.75,https://reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1oe5gg3/rebalancing_portfolio_while_considering_capital/,0.021,0.897,0.082,0.9568

2025-10-22 15:44:44,ETFs,QQQ ETF -I need to clarify the expenses for current UIT and potential new re-class as an open-ended ETF.,"Under the current class as UIT, Invesco/QQQ  is only reimbursed for marketing and administrative expenses. The other operational costs are paid to third-party providers, such as licensing fees to Nasdaq and trustee fees to the bank (currently BNY Mellon).

Under the Proposed structure -Open-ended ETF. QQQ would become the investment adviser and collect the entire 0.18% expense ratio as a management fee. Invesco/QQQ would then use this revenue to pay the fund's expenses, including: Index licensing fees to Nasdaq. The Nasdaq license fee is a major expense for the fund. New Board of Trustees compensation. A newly created board would oversee the fund for the first time. Administrative and operational costs, including services provided by third parties, such as the custodian and administrator (BNY Mellon). Marketing expenses. It would fund marketing expenses from the management fee, rather than receiving separate reimbursements.

This is the summary I collected. It seems to me that under the new proposal open-eded ETF. This QQQ ETF will have the additional expense of paying the board members who will manage the fund, correct? so comparing to current structure, the QQQ will have more expenses for the compensation to board members (9 of them). Then, the expense ratio for investors will go down from .20 to .18%. What are they paying now that is not going to be an expense in the future. Anyone could clarify?

2025-10-17 08:09:18,ETFs,I read the QQQ proxy statement so you don't have to,"QQQ has a proxy vote deadline set for October 23, 2025\*\*\* for a meeting the next day regarding three proposals. The link can be found here: [https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/proxy-vote-information.html](https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/proxy-vote-information.html).

  
\*\*\* They have changed it to December 5, 2025 so they have more time to get the required number needed to reach the quorum.

I read the proxy statement (not including the Appendices), and below are my notes (with some of my musings thrown in). No ChatGPT, just ChatGP-Me. I wrote them in Markdown, so hopefully they translate properly onto reddit. I apologize in advance for typos, I wrote them raw into Notepad, so there is no grammar or spell check, and I probably shouldn't have done this with no sleep. Also, the notes are written as if I am talking to myself, so please forgive the informality.

We can discuss more in the comments if needed. I'm sure I missed things and made mistakes, and we can treat this as a discussion rather than a set in stone display of information.

Before reading my notes, let me put the tl;dr:

At the end of the day, this will *probably* benefit the average shareholder. The flexibility *could* be a good way to juice the funds returns ever so slightly, and the ever so slight decrease in expense ratio as well as the flattening of the expense ratio into a single fee, are good things. However, as you all know, they recommend voting yes for all three proposals, and reading the proxy statement you can see that bias throughout. This leaves mixed feelings because you can see conflicts of interest and the new structure means they will be less beholden to you, the shareholder, though they are still bound by certain legal requirements (however they frame this as a positive because they can make decisions faster). Also, they seem to be holding out on us in terms of savings they could provide. What do you guys think?

# THE NOTES

Page numbers refer to the page numbers written on the actual pages, not the ones counted by the PDF reader.

# Overview

* Want to restructure from unit investment trust (UIT) to exchange traded fund (ETF).
   * No tax impact.
   * Expense ratio from 0.20% --> 0.18% ($70 million in savings based on 2025 figures).
   * Specifically they want Open-End Fund ETF.
   * Will still track Nasdaq-100 index.
* Three proposals
   1. Approve amendments to the Trust’s Trust Indenture and Agreement and Standard Terms and Conditions of Trust that are intended to change the Trust’s classification under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, from a UIT to an Open-End Fund (i.e., an open- end management investment company).
   2. Approve the election of nine (9) trustees to serve on a newly established Board of Trustees of the Trust.
   3. Approve an investment advisory agreement between the Trust and Invesco.
* **All three proposals have to be accepted to go into effect.**
   * That's why they are pushing so hard.
   * They are using Sodali & Co. Fund Services, which is a proxy solictor service to call people.
* Invesco wants you to vote yes to all 3 proposals.
* They need at least 50% of people to vote for this to even make the meeting happening.
   * They count people who don't vote as still present anyway for they purpose getting the meeting started.
* They need at least 51% of the outstanding shares to vote yes to get Proposal 1 to pass.
   * That's why they are spamming everyone like crazy.
   * Absent/non votes count as NO, so they desperately need to reach all shareholders.
* Between all the mail and Sodali, they estimated $40 million spent by the way \[pg. 10\].

# Proposal 1 - UIT to ETF

* Will allow them to do some lending that they couldn't before.
   * Theoretically increases returns?
   * Invesco will directly profit from securities lending too.
   * They admit this could add extra risk to QQQ \[pg. 6\].
* They will be allowed to use affliates of Invesco to send order flow (couldn't do that as a UIT).
   * They outright admit this is a conflict of interest \[pg. 6\].
      * Specifically because they can generate brokerage commissions off of doing this that goes to themselves.
   * But don't worry they will make a board to make sure they are good :) \[pg. 7\].
* They will be allowed to use synthetic products in QQQ \[pg. 12\].
* They keep citing ""Greater Regulatory Certainty"".
   * All that means is because Open-End ETFs are more popular than UITs, they get legislated on more \[pg. 13\].
   * And they use the example that Open-End ETFs are legally required to send certain documents more often \[pg. 17\].
      * But like, you can still send them anyway if you want to be so transparent.
* Currently they have to hold all dividends and such as uninvested cash until they give it to us.
   * They say the new model will allow cash reinvestment for ""potentially"" better return \[pg. 15\].
* Also they will be allowed to change things easier because the amount of approval needed goes down.
   * They frame this as a benefit because they won't have to spend so much money on trying to reach shareholders \[pg. 14\].
* Page 14 to 16 is a table summary of what happens when going from UIT to Open-End ETF, but be warned, it is written in a way to that gives a positive bias to the Open-End ETF proposal.

# Proposal 2 - Election of 9 trustees

* Currently QQQ has Bank of New York (BNY) as trustee.
* If vote yes, we replace BNY with the 9 people.
   * BNY will continue to serve as custodian of QQQ.
* All are finance people with years of experience
   * And one of them is obviously one of the big wigs of Invesco, Brian Hartigan
* The list is:
   1. Mr. Ronn R. Bagge
   2. Mr. Todd J. Barre
   3. Mr. Brian Hartigan
   4. Ms. Victoria J. Herget
   5. Mr. Marc M. Kole

   * The Audit Committee
   * The Investment Oversight Committee
   * The Nominating and Governance Committee
* These 9 people already work at Invesco in some capacity currently and at a minimum make like $300k a year

# Proposal 3 - Advisory agreement between QQQ and Invesco

* Remember current Trustee is BNY.
* ETF needs an advisor and thus Invesco will serve as that role.
* So Invesco goes from Sponsor of Trust (which means they get to make decisions about the port), to adviser, which means they now get paid by the trust.
* What this means is before, BNY would take fees out of QQQ to pay for necessary licensing and reimburse QQQ for marketing expenses and other admin stuff.
* Of course BNY got a little bit of cash for acting as the trustee too (0.04%) \[pg. 37\].
* So really Invesco wasn't making that much money on QQQ.
* But now they will get paid as an adviser and make BANK.
   * Of course, they will now have to pay the stuff like licensing fees.
   * They call the adviser fee an all-in-one management fee.
      * Thus they will use all the cash they get to pay stuff like licensing, marketing, etc.
   * They call this a switch from non-unitary to unitary fee.
* In short:
   * Currently we pay all fees out of QQQ ourselves and that makes up the 0.20% expense.
   * With this change we pay 0.18% to Invesco, and they will use the funds to pay fees for us (and keep the rest for themselves).
* So how are we getting the 0.02% saving?
   * Well since Invesco will have to pay marketing stuff now, rather than have use QQQ (aka WE THE SHAREHOLDERS) pay for it, the guys are slashing the marketing fund from 0.08% to 0.02% to 0.03% \[pg. 36\].
   * This represents 0.05% to 0.06% savings and that's what is getting ""passed"" onto us \[pg. 36\].
      * So we get 0.02% savings and they keep 0.03% to 0.04%!!
   * So... they decreased spending on marketing because it use to be reimbursed by us, but now they get to keep the money.
   * A part of this makes me think, could they have always done this?
   * Did they hold onto this meager savings to make more people vote yes??
   * Did they hold off because they didn't care because it wasn't their money but now that they can make $10s of millions NOW they want to slash the marketing budget and put it in their pockets and entice us to vote yes because they give us a 0.02% reduction???
* Also Trustee Fee, really the BNY fee, will go from 0.04 to 0.035% \[pg. 39\].
* They admit that because Invesco will now make money from QQQ rather than BNY getting all the fees, there is a new conflict of interest where they may not act in QQQ's best interest \[pg. 7\].
* A benefit is that the flat 0.18% means they should theoretically absorb any price fluctuations for things like licensing, but do fees ever go back up??
   * I feel like historically they only ever go down.
   * And if they ever did go up, I'm certain they would increase the expense ratio to pass the buck onto us.",19,12,0.86,https://reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1o8zjow/i_read_the_qqq_proxy_statement_so_you_dont_have_to/,0.028,0.86,0.112,0.9992
2025-10-17 00:11:49,ETFs,QQQ Proxy Voting - my research & conclusions,"*\[I've commented the below on folks' posts, apologies if you saw this already\]*

I just spent the past couple of hours researching this after being bombarded with an insane amount of mail from Invesco. It felt like that scene from Harry Potter where Hogwarts is trying to get in touch with Harry, except instead of being invited to attend a magical wizarding school I'm being told to proxy vote on three proposals for the future of my hard earned muggle money investments. Almost as fun...

I truly believe the one big positive from the Gamestop shitstorm was showing a large group of individuals organising and speaking as one makes an impact and can compete with the Goliath institutional investors.  Below is more detailed rationale my votes. Proposals #2 and #3 are dependent on Proposal #1 passing (ie: if Proposal #1 to change the classification doesn't pass, the other two proposals don't matter regardless of how folks vote on them). If you voted already, don't worry - you can still amend your vote before October 23.

**TLDR: Invesco has the most to gain if Proposal 1 passes while we shareholders have a 2bps fee reduction to gain. I voted ""For"" on Proposal 1, voted individually on Trustees on Proposal 2, and voted ""Against"" for Proposal 3 to send a message to Invesco: Come back with a better deal for your shareholders if you want us to sign on. You clearly spent millions on outreaching us, obviously you want this deal. Don't insult us with 2bps chump change.**



**Voted ""For"" Proposal 1:** Changing QQQ's classification from a unit investment trust (“UIT”) to an open-end management investment company. Pro: Would reduce fees by 2bps. Con: Like others have already pointed out, why not more?  
I voted ""**For**"" on this because it would ultimately benefit us. But looking at the other large open-end large ETS their fees range from 3 to 9bps (exception being Russell's IWF at 18bps), so wtf is Invesco doing wasting our time and killing all these trees to come to us with a pitiful 2bps reduction to 18?! Seriously, I almost voted ""Against"" because it's so freaking insulting Invesco blew so much money on this campaign just to treat us like idiots. 

source from Strategas Research Partners, 09/09/2025: [https://www.riskbridgeadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/qqq.png.webp](https://www.riskbridgeadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/qqq.png.webp)



**Voted Individually on Proposal 2:** Electing 9 individual Trustees to replace the current Trustee (a bank). Invesco auto-selected for us to vote ""For"" across the board. That really rubbed me the wrong way and I spent a good chunk of my time investing all the individual trustees to make my own selection. In a capitalist society, money is power and it's about dang time I use my hard earned muggle dollars to make however small an impact I possibly have. Below is how I selected for the Trustees, feel free to DM me for details or even better, research this yourself to make an informed decision:

Ronn R. Bagge: Withhold 

Todd J. Barre: For 

Brian Hartigan: For 

Victoria J. Herget: For 

Marc M. Kole: Withhold 

Yung Bong Lim: For 

Joanne Pace: For 

Gary R. Wicker: For 

Donald H. Wilson: Against



**Voted ""Against"" Proposal 3:** Invesco is proposing to serve as the Trust’s investment adviser. This for me is the kicker, if they want this to happen, come back to us with something better. I think this is how we can send the message ""Naw, don't insult us, work a little harder on this. Show us how much you want it."" I voted ""Against"" for Proposal 3 for all the reasons I explained above. I believe we shareholders can get a lot better deal and this is our chance to achieve it. If we blindly vote ""For"" on all three proposals, we've lost our voice and the Goliaths will have their chance to pull the strings behind the scenes while we get a pathetic 2bps reduction, which will be the **HIGHEST** fee of the large open-end ETFs.

2025-10-15 03:06:14,ETFs,Thoughts on 70% QTUM and 30%  VOO for a Roth IRA?,"I am considering a Roth IRA allocation of 70%
QTUM (Defiance Quantum ETF) and 30% VOO (S&P 500).

My reasoning is that I see quantum and AI as the next major technological wave, and I want heavier exposure early. I’m 26 years old and see QPUs as a potential game changer world wide; QTUM is essentially a niche slice of QQQ right? Basically our next forefront of technology and all for a quarter of the price (Right now at ~$112). I understand the consequences and setting myself up to be less diversified, but I’m willing to take that volatility long term since I don’t plan to touch it for decades.

Would this be too risky, or does it make sense if I have high conviction in tech’s long-term trajectory? Is this smart conviction or just gambling with my future?

Devil’s advocate:
– “VOO and forget” is the usual wisdom, especially now with political uncertainty and talk of diversifying internationally.
– The AI bubble could pop hard, and many quantum companies are still more theory than revenue.
– Much of the current momentum is geopolitical (US vs China race) rather than consumer driven.

But:
– A loss in this sector could have massive cybersecurity implications, giving more incentive to succeed.
– Companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM, and IonQ are showing tangible progress.
– Awareness and funding for quantum tech are ramping up fast.

I’m thinking 20-30 years out and believe we’ll see exponential growth and widespread integration of quantum and AI tech. This could mirror early stage AI or semiconductor growth. Curious how others in this sub balance conviction in emerging tech against long term diversification.


How would you balance QTUM vs. VOO? What’s your take on my reasoning? ",0,10,0.4,https://reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1o74759/thoughts_on_70_qtum_and_30_voo_for_a_roth_ira/,0.03,0.853,0.117,0.9852

My goal is to do slow-long term investing. As I said, I was thinking VOO was the safest bet, however I also think technology-based ETFs are really promising, given the fact that we are entering the age of AI, quantum computing and so on, So Im thinking perhaps technology-ETFs are the way to go and that they have more returns.

2025-10-12 17:31:04,ETFs,Why I voted NO on the QQQ Proposal for Open End Fund,"This is very simple.  QQQ is not broken.  Invesco has not adequately explained to all of us why they are proposing this.  

1. This gives Invesco the ability control QQQ with any future changes they deem ""prudent"" to a board that will be next to impossible for us ""shareholders"" to change.  Average boardmember pay for 5 meetings a year will be about $400k for 8 trustees about $3M total.  See Links:  [https://funddirections.com/news/79155/invesco-plans-conversion-that-would-give-358b-etf-a-board-for-the-first-time/](https://funddirections.com/news/79155/invesco-plans-conversion-that-would-give-358b-etf-a-board-for-the-first-time/)and  [https://www.thompsonhine.com/insights/understanding-the-qqq-conversion-from-uit-to-open-end-etf/](https://www.thompsonhine.com/insights/understanding-the-qqq-conversion-from-uit-to-open-end-etf/)

2. The day this was announced, Invesco shares soared 15% the day this was announced because it also gives them the ability to not only recover marketing fees but also profit.  Estimates are that Invesco has the potential to reap $700 million in potential revenue.  (Link:  [https://www.investopedia.com/why-invesco-stock-is-soaring-after-proposing-this-change-to-qqq-etf-11775102](https://www.investopedia.com/why-invesco-stock-is-soaring-after-proposing-this-change-to-qqq-etf-11775102) .)  It is not explained how this arrangement benefits us.  Does the institutional trustee Bank of New York Mellon take the entire 0.02% management fee minus marketing as profit today?  This has not been adequately explained by Invesco how they are going to make more money and yet the ETF Shareholder wins ( Link:  [https://funddirections.com/news/79155/invesco-plans-conversion-that-would-give-358b-etf-a-board-for-the-first-time/](https://funddirections.com/news/79155/invesco-plans-conversion-that-would-give-358b-etf-a-board-for-the-first-time/) ).  

This is all upside for Invesco.  If this goes through, half joking, perhaps Invesco (IVZ) ends up being the better investment than QQQ ?  At any rate,  I did appreciate the emailed online voting instructions that allowed me to bypass the rude solicitors who hung up on me when I wouldn't commit to voting yes over the telephone.  I think that said it all.  The 3 calls per day I hope now end (holdings in 3 differenct accounts).

He has a military compensation that we can manage to live off (modestly) and he is considering going back to some kind of job. As the “checkbook holder” and long time stay at home wife, I’ve had some time (4 months) to learn a little through YouTube, Reddit and watching the moves our financial planners are making and not making. In the 4 months anticipating what to do with the Rollover that he is letting me manage, I have an opened a brokerage account that I’ve managed to gain 20% investing in individual stocks (NVDIA, NBIS, APPLE, IREN, CRWV, TMQ, INTC), I have also invested in ETFs (VTI, VOO, VUG, QQQ and VSUS). My gains so far on those are roughly 5%. I have saved 6 months of living expenses which I parked into a HYSA.

The question is, will the US market continue to outperform other markets around the world long-term as it has done traditionally, or, jump ship to something a bit more exciting like QQQ or another market tracker like that of the Chinese, Spanish or Indian one, for example?

I’m also wondering if I should stick to just three ETFs. I’m planning to invest around $300–$400 per month, but I’m not sure if I’m spreading my investments too thin. My main core is VOO/VTI, QQQ, and VXUS. I’ll probably just add about 10% to SCHD and BND. Thanks.

2025-10-29 13:06:03,ETFs,Help focusing on less ETFs in portfolio,"Hi,

Need advice on consolidating and focusing spend on just a few ETFs to DAV into each month.

59yo. Look to retire in 5 years. Can stomach market swings. Have 1M even in an 401k.

Just got done paying for house, colleges, wedding. No Debt. Time to focus on the nest egg.

Started a year ago putting $2,200 a month into ETFs. Thinking in retirement, I would like the ETF portfolio to pay off property taxes, some vacation money, etc. It would be filler to SSN and 401k drawdown. Thought it might be better just to sell off the ETF funds in retirement as needed, rather than rely on the slow growing/flat dividend stocks. Do Have about $25k in 10-15 individual Dividend paying funds (O, MO, SUN, CVX, etc) that pays out $3k a year, that I'm not adding to.

Started with 3 ETFS: QQQI + VOO + VGT. Waiting to see what the tax bill year 1 is for QQQI and what it does longer term.  Then went down the rabbit hold of reading and watching youtube, and thought I should ""diversify"", and ended up adding SCHG and SPMO. The SMH is a recent long term thing I just started, to get into the AI space for long term, maybe get to a 2-5% of overall as a home run swing for 10-20 years.

I did also add some positions in Dividend funds VYMI and SCYB for more dividend income (I can't kick the dividends mentality totally, see QQQI), and am thinking maybe in 5 years at retirement, start converting the other ETFs into the ""safer"" dividend and bond funds? Haven't figured that out yet.

Here's what I have so far:

MKT VAL   QTY        DIV-YLD

QQQI   NEOS NASDAQ 100 HIGH INCOME ETF      $9,244.76   165.9      13.95%

VOO    VANGUARD S&P 500 ETF                             $6,357.93  10.05        1.10%

VGT     VANGUARD INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY $4,810.89     6.0           0.44%

SCHG   SCHWAB US LARGE CAP GROWTH ETF       $2,387.72     71            0.36%

SPMO  INVSC S P 500 MOMENTUM ETF                  $1,117.31      9           0.62%

VYMI   VANGUARD INTERNATNL HGH DIV YLD      $1,553.76      18           3.25%

SCYB   SCHWAB HIGH YIELD BOND ETF                   $1,014.41      38           6.73%

SMH    VANECK SEMICONDUCTOR ETF                   $368.74          1            0.30%

$26,855.52

I Know I have sprawl and overlap in the portfolio right now. Which ones do I keep? Which ones do I consolidate out of and roll that $ into?  With a 5-10 year window what's the best course of action?

Going forward each month, was thinking of splitting the monthly dav equally into these 3? SPMO+SCHG+VGT

I've decided that I would like to add a little more risk to the portfolio for more potential long term growth while also slightly leaning the portfolio towards tech, so I have changed my main investing pie to include 60% Vanguard FTSE all world, 25% Vanguard S&P 500, 10% in Xtrackers NASDAQ 100 and 5% to go in gold.

I've also made another pie with some more risky etf and plan to invest 10% of my monthly saving amount into this and the rest (90%) into the main pie described above.

2025-10-17 08:09:18,ETFs,I read the QQQ proxy statement so you don't have to,"QQQ has a proxy vote deadline set for October 23, 2025\*\*\* for a meeting the next day regarding three proposals. The link can be found here: [https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/proxy-vote-information.html](https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/proxy-vote-information.html).

  
\*\*\* They have changed it to December 5, 2025 so they have more time to get the required number needed to reach the quorum.

I read the proxy statement (not including the Appendices), and below are my notes (with some of my musings thrown in). No ChatGPT, just ChatGP-Me. I wrote them in Markdown, so hopefully they translate properly onto reddit. I apologize in advance for typos, I wrote them raw into Notepad, so there is no grammar or spell check, and I probably shouldn't have done this with no sleep. Also, the notes are written as if I am talking to myself, so please forgive the informality.

We can discuss more in the comments if needed. I'm sure I missed things and made mistakes, and we can treat this as a discussion rather than a set in stone display of information.

Before reading my notes, let me put the tl;dr:

At the end of the day, this will *probably* benefit the average shareholder. The flexibility *could* be a good way to juice the funds returns ever so slightly, and the ever so slight decrease in expense ratio as well as the flattening of the expense ratio into a single fee, are good things. However, as you all know, they recommend voting yes for all three proposals, and reading the proxy statement you can see that bias throughout. This leaves mixed feelings because you can see conflicts of interest and the new structure means they will be less beholden to you, the shareholder, though they are still bound by certain legal requirements (however they frame this as a positive because they can make decisions faster). Also, they seem to be holding out on us in terms of savings they could provide. What do you guys think?

# THE NOTES

Page numbers refer to the page numbers written on the actual pages, not the ones counted by the PDF reader.

# Overview

* Want to restructure from unit investment trust (UIT) to exchange traded fund (ETF).
   * No tax impact.
   * Expense ratio from 0.20% --> 0.18% ($70 million in savings based on 2025 figures).
   * Specifically they want Open-End Fund ETF.
   * Will still track Nasdaq-100 index.
* Three proposals
   1. Approve amendments to the Trust’s Trust Indenture and Agreement and Standard Terms and Conditions of Trust that are intended to change the Trust’s classification under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, from a UIT to an Open-End Fund (i.e., an open- end management investment company).
   2. Approve the election of nine (9) trustees to serve on a newly established Board of Trustees of the Trust.
   3. Approve an investment advisory agreement between the Trust and Invesco.
* **All three proposals have to be accepted to go into effect.**
   * That's why they are pushing so hard.
   * They are using Sodali & Co. Fund Services, which is a proxy solictor service to call people.
* Invesco wants you to vote yes to all 3 proposals.
* They need at least 50% of people to vote for this to even make the meeting happening.
   * They count people who don't vote as still present anyway for they purpose getting the meeting started.
* They need at least 51% of the outstanding shares to vote yes to get Proposal 1 to pass.
   * That's why they are spamming everyone like crazy.
   * Absent/non votes count as NO, so they desperately need to reach all shareholders.
* Between all the mail and Sodali, they estimated $40 million spent by the way \[pg. 10\].

# Proposal 1 - UIT to ETF

* Will allow them to do some lending that they couldn't before.
   * Theoretically increases returns?
   * Invesco will directly profit from securities lending too.
   * They admit this could add extra risk to QQQ \[pg. 6\].
* They will be allowed to use affliates of Invesco to send order flow (couldn't do that as a UIT).
   * They outright admit this is a conflict of interest \[pg. 6\].
      * Specifically because they can generate brokerage commissions off of doing this that goes to themselves.
   * But don't worry they will make a board to make sure they are good :) \[pg. 7\].
* They will be allowed to use synthetic products in QQQ \[pg. 12\].
* They keep citing ""Greater Regulatory Certainty"".
   * All that means is because Open-End ETFs are more popular than UITs, they get legislated on more \[pg. 13\].
   * And they use the example that Open-End ETFs are legally required to send certain documents more often \[pg. 17\].
      * But like, you can still send them anyway if you want to be so transparent.
* Currently they have to hold all dividends and such as uninvested cash until they give it to us.
   * They say the new model will allow cash reinvestment for ""potentially"" better return \[pg. 15\].
* Also they will be allowed to change things easier because the amount of approval needed goes down.
   * They frame this as a benefit because they won't have to spend so much money on trying to reach shareholders \[pg. 14\].
* Page 14 to 16 is a table summary of what happens when going from UIT to Open-End ETF, but be warned, it is written in a way to that gives a positive bias to the Open-End ETF proposal.

# Proposal 2 - Election of 9 trustees

* Currently QQQ has Bank of New York (BNY) as trustee.
* If vote yes, we replace BNY with the 9 people.
   * BNY will continue to serve as custodian of QQQ.
* All are finance people with years of experience
   * And one of them is obviously one of the big wigs of Invesco, Brian Hartigan
* The list is:
   1. Mr. Ronn R. Bagge
   2. Mr. Todd J. Barre
   3. Mr. Brian Hartigan
   4. Ms. Victoria J. Herget
   5. Mr. Marc M. Kole

* Mr. Donald H. Wilson will be the Chair
* Mr. Ronn R. Bagge will be vice chair
* They'll have three committees to handle decisions \[pg. 30\]:
   * The Audit Committee
   * The Investment Oversight Committee
   * The Nominating and Governance Committee
* These 9 people already work at Invesco in some capacity currently and at a minimum make like $300k a year

# Proposal 3 - Advisory agreement between QQQ and Invesco

* Remember current Trustee is BNY.
* ETF needs an advisor and thus Invesco will serve as that role.
* So Invesco goes from Sponsor of Trust (which means they get to make decisions about the port), to adviser, which means they now get paid by the trust.
* What this means is before, BNY would take fees out of QQQ to pay for necessary licensing and reimburse QQQ for marketing expenses and other admin stuff.
* Of course BNY got a little bit of cash for acting as the trustee too (0.04%) \[pg. 37\].
* So really Invesco wasn't making that much money on QQQ.
* But now they will get paid as an adviser and make BANK.
   * Of course, they will now have to pay the stuff like licensing fees.
   * They call the adviser fee an all-in-one management fee.
      * Thus they will use all the cash they get to pay stuff like licensing, marketing, etc.
   * They call this a switch from non-unitary to unitary fee.
* In short:
   * Currently we pay all fees out of QQQ ourselves and that makes up the 0.20% expense.
   * With this change we pay 0.18% to Invesco, and they will use the funds to pay fees for us (and keep the rest for themselves).
* So how are we getting the 0.02% saving?
   * Well since Invesco will have to pay marketing stuff now, rather than have use QQQ (aka WE THE SHAREHOLDERS) pay for it, the guys are slashing the marketing fund from 0.08% to 0.02% to 0.03% \[pg. 36\].
   * This represents 0.05% to 0.06% savings and that's what is getting ""passed"" onto us \[pg. 36\].
      * So we get 0.02% savings and they keep 0.03% to 0.04%!!
   * So... they decreased spending on marketing because it use to be reimbursed by us, but now they get to keep the money.
   * A part of this makes me think, could they have always done this?
   * Did they hold onto this meager savings to make more people vote yes??
   * Did they hold off because they didn't care because it wasn't their money but now that they can make $10s of millions NOW they want to slash the marketing budget and put it in their pockets and entice us to vote yes because they give us a 0.02% reduction???
* Also Trustee Fee, really the BNY fee, will go from 0.04 to 0.035% \[pg. 39\].
* They admit that because Invesco will now make money from QQQ rather than BNY getting all the fees, there is a new conflict of interest where they may not act in QQQ's best interest \[pg. 7\].
* A benefit is that the flat 0.18% means they should theoretically absorb any price fluctuations for things like licensing, but do fees ever go back up??
   * I feel like historically they only ever go down.
   * And if they ever did go up, I'm certain they would increase the expense ratio to pass the buck onto us.",20,12,0.86,https://reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1o8zjow/i_read_the_qqq_proxy_statement_so_you_dont_have_to/,0.028,0.86,0.112,0.9992

* IWDA - Developed World ex-US
* IEMA - Emerging Markets
* EQQQ - Nasdaq 100
* IB01 - U.S. Treasuries 1–3 years
* IBTM - U.S. Treasuries 7–10 years
* AGGU - Global Aggregate Bonds (USD unhedged)
* IBCX - Euro Gov Bonds 1–3 years

1. start actively managing the fund instead of tracking the index. As a mutual fund, they will be able to do whatever they want.
2. RAISE FEES whenever they want. They might not do this immediately, but they will be able to.

I'd rather pay the current expense ratio then give the fund over to managers who say I can trust them. Am I wrong?

2025-10-22 15:44:44,ETFs,QQQ ETF -I need to clarify the expenses for current UIT and potential new re-class as an open-ended ETF.,"Under the current class as UIT, Invesco/QQQ  is only reimbursed for marketing and administrative expenses. The other operational costs are paid to third-party providers, such as licensing fees to Nasdaq and trustee fees to the bank (currently BNY Mellon).

Under the Proposed structure -Open-ended ETF. QQQ would become the investment adviser and collect the entire 0.18% expense ratio as a management fee. Invesco/QQQ would then use this revenue to pay the fund's expenses, including: Index licensing fees to Nasdaq. The Nasdaq license fee is a major expense for the fund. New Board of Trustees compensation. A newly created board would oversee the fund for the first time. Administrative and operational costs, including services provided by third parties, such as the custodian and administrator (BNY Mellon). Marketing expenses. It would fund marketing expenses from the management fee, rather than receiving separate reimbursements.

This is the summary I collected. It seems to me that under the new proposal open-eded ETF. This QQQ ETF will have the additional expense of paying the board members who will manage the fund, correct? so comparing to current structure, the QQQ will have more expenses for the compensation to board members (9 of them). Then, the expense ratio for investors will go down from .20 to .18%. What are they paying now that is not going to be an expense in the future. Anyone could clarify?

2025-10-17 08:09:18,ETFs,I read the QQQ proxy statement so you don't have to,"QQQ has a proxy vote deadline set for October 23, 2025\*\*\* for a meeting the next day regarding three proposals. The link can be found here: [https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/proxy-vote-information.html](https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/proxy-vote-information.html).

  
\*\*\* They have changed it to December 5, 2025 so they have more time to get the required number needed to reach the quorum.

I read the proxy statement (not including the Appendices), and below are my notes (with some of my musings thrown in). No ChatGPT, just ChatGP-Me. I wrote them in Markdown, so hopefully they translate properly onto reddit. I apologize in advance for typos, I wrote them raw into Notepad, so there is no grammar or spell check, and I probably shouldn't have done this with no sleep. Also, the notes are written as if I am talking to myself, so please forgive the informality.

We can discuss more in the comments if needed. I'm sure I missed things and made mistakes, and we can treat this as a discussion rather than a set in stone display of information.

Before reading my notes, let me put the tl;dr:

At the end of the day, this will *probably* benefit the average shareholder. The flexibility *could* be a good way to juice the funds returns ever so slightly, and the ever so slight decrease in expense ratio as well as the flattening of the expense ratio into a single fee, are good things. However, as you all know, they recommend voting yes for all three proposals, and reading the proxy statement you can see that bias throughout. This leaves mixed feelings because you can see conflicts of interest and the new structure means they will be less beholden to you, the shareholder, though they are still bound by certain legal requirements (however they frame this as a positive because they can make decisions faster). Also, they seem to be holding out on us in terms of savings they could provide. What do you guys think?

# THE NOTES

Page numbers refer to the page numbers written on the actual pages, not the ones counted by the PDF reader.

# Overview

* Want to restructure from unit investment trust (UIT) to exchange traded fund (ETF).
   * No tax impact.
   * Expense ratio from 0.20% --> 0.18% ($70 million in savings based on 2025 figures).
   * Specifically they want Open-End Fund ETF.
   * Will still track Nasdaq-100 index.
* Three proposals
   1. Approve amendments to the Trust’s Trust Indenture and Agreement and Standard Terms and Conditions of Trust that are intended to change the Trust’s classification under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, from a UIT to an Open-End Fund (i.e., an open- end management investment company).
   2. Approve the election of nine (9) trustees to serve on a newly established Board of Trustees of the Trust.
   3. Approve an investment advisory agreement between the Trust and Invesco.
* **All three proposals have to be accepted to go into effect.**
   * That's why they are pushing so hard.
   * They are using Sodali & Co. Fund Services, which is a proxy solictor service to call people.
* Invesco wants you to vote yes to all 3 proposals.
* They need at least 50% of people to vote for this to even make the meeting happening.
   * They count people who don't vote as still present anyway for they purpose getting the meeting started.
* They need at least 51% of the outstanding shares to vote yes to get Proposal 1 to pass.
   * That's why they are spamming everyone like crazy.
   * Absent/non votes count as NO, so they desperately need to reach all shareholders.
* Between all the mail and Sodali, they estimated $40 million spent by the way \[pg. 10\].

# Proposal 1 - UIT to ETF

* Will allow them to do some lending that they couldn't before.
   * Theoretically increases returns?
   * Invesco will directly profit from securities lending too.
   * They admit this could add extra risk to QQQ \[pg. 6\].
* They will be allowed to use affliates of Invesco to send order flow (couldn't do that as a UIT).
   * They outright admit this is a conflict of interest \[pg. 6\].
      * Specifically because they can generate brokerage commissions off of doing this that goes to themselves.
   * But don't worry they will make a board to make sure they are good :) \[pg. 7\].
* They will be allowed to use synthetic products in QQQ \[pg. 12\].
* They keep citing ""Greater Regulatory Certainty"".
   * All that means is because Open-End ETFs are more popular than UITs, they get legislated on more \[pg. 13\].
   * And they use the example that Open-End ETFs are legally required to send certain documents more often \[pg. 17\].
      * But like, you can still send them anyway if you want to be so transparent.
* Currently they have to hold all dividends and such as uninvested cash until they give it to us.
   * They say the new model will allow cash reinvestment for ""potentially"" better return \[pg. 15\].
* Also they will be allowed to change things easier because the amount of approval needed goes down.
   * They frame this as a benefit because they won't have to spend so much money on trying to reach shareholders \[pg. 14\].
* Page 14 to 16 is a table summary of what happens when going from UIT to Open-End ETF, but be warned, it is written in a way to that gives a positive bias to the Open-End ETF proposal.

# Proposal 2 - Election of 9 trustees

* Currently QQQ has Bank of New York (BNY) as trustee.
* If vote yes, we replace BNY with the 9 people.
   * BNY will continue to serve as custodian of QQQ.
* All are finance people with years of experience
   * And one of them is obviously one of the big wigs of Invesco, Brian Hartigan
* The list is:
   1. Mr. Ronn R. Bagge
   2. Mr. Todd J. Barre

   * The Investment Oversight Committee
   * The Nominating and Governance Committee
* These 9 people already work at Invesco in some capacity currently and at a minimum make like $300k a year

# Proposal 3 - Advisory agreement between QQQ and Invesco

* Remember current Trustee is BNY.
* ETF needs an advisor and thus Invesco will serve as that role.
* So Invesco goes from Sponsor of Trust (which means they get to make decisions about the port), to adviser, which means they now get paid by the trust.
* What this means is before, BNY would take fees out of QQQ to pay for necessary licensing and reimburse QQQ for marketing expenses and other admin stuff.
* Of course BNY got a little bit of cash for acting as the trustee too (0.04%) \[pg. 37\].
* So really Invesco wasn't making that much money on QQQ.
* But now they will get paid as an adviser and make BANK.
   * Of course, they will now have to pay the stuff like licensing fees.
   * They call the adviser fee an all-in-one management fee.
      * Thus they will use all the cash they get to pay stuff like licensing, marketing, etc.
   * They call this a switch from non-unitary to unitary fee.
* In short:
   * Currently we pay all fees out of QQQ ourselves and that makes up the 0.20% expense.
   * With this change we pay 0.18% to Invesco, and they will use the funds to pay fees for us (and keep the rest for themselves).
* So how are we getting the 0.02% saving?
   * Well since Invesco will have to pay marketing stuff now, rather than have use QQQ (aka WE THE SHAREHOLDERS) pay for it, the guys are slashing the marketing fund from 0.08% to 0.02% to 0.03% \[pg. 36\].
   * This represents 0.05% to 0.06% savings and that's what is getting ""passed"" onto us \[pg. 36\].
      * So we get 0.02% savings and they keep 0.03% to 0.04%!!
   * So... they decreased spending on marketing because it use to be reimbursed by us, but now they get to keep the money.
   * A part of this makes me think, could they have always done this?
   * Did they hold onto this meager savings to make more people vote yes??
   * Did they hold off because they didn't care because it wasn't their money but now that they can make $10s of millions NOW they want to slash the marketing budget and put it in their pockets and entice us to vote yes because they give us a 0.02% reduction???
* Also Trustee Fee, really the BNY fee, will go from 0.04 to 0.035% \[pg. 39\].
* They admit that because Invesco will now make money from QQQ rather than BNY getting all the fees, there is a new conflict of interest where they may not act in QQQ's best interest \[pg. 7\].
* A benefit is that the flat 0.18% means they should theoretically absorb any price fluctuations for things like licensing, but do fees ever go back up??
   * I feel like historically they only ever go down.
   * And if they ever did go up, I'm certain they would increase the expense ratio to pass the buck onto us.",20,12,0.88,https://reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1o8zjow/i_read_the_qqq_proxy_statement_so_you_dont_have_to/,0.028,0.86,0.112,0.9992
2025-10-17 00:11:49,ETFs,QQQ Proxy Voting - my research & conclusions,"*\[I've commented the below on folks' posts, apologies if you saw this already\]*

I just spent the past couple of hours researching this after being bombarded with an insane amount of mail from Invesco. It felt like that scene from Harry Potter where Hogwarts is trying to get in touch with Harry, except instead of being invited to attend a magical wizarding school I'm being told to proxy vote on three proposals for the future of my hard earned muggle money investments. Almost as fun...

I truly believe the one big positive from the Gamestop shitstorm was showing a large group of individuals organising and speaking as one makes an impact and can compete with the Goliath institutional investors.  Below is more detailed rationale my votes. Proposals #2 and #3 are dependent on Proposal #1 passing (ie: if Proposal #1 to change the classification doesn't pass, the other two proposals don't matter regardless of how folks vote on them). If you voted already, don't worry - you can still amend your vote before October 23.

**TLDR: Invesco has the most to gain if Proposal 1 passes while we shareholders have a 2bps fee reduction to gain. I voted ""For"" on Proposal 1, voted individually on Trustees on Proposal 2, and voted ""Against"" for Proposal 3 to send a message to Invesco: Come back with a better deal for your shareholders if you want us to sign on. You clearly spent millions on outreaching us, obviously you want this deal. Don't insult us with 2bps chump change.**



**Voted ""For"" Proposal 1:** Changing QQQ's classification from a unit investment trust (“UIT”) to an open-end management investment company. Pro: Would reduce fees by 2bps. Con: Like others have already pointed out, why not more?  
I voted ""**For**"" on this because it would ultimately benefit us. But looking at the other large open-end large ETS their fees range from 3 to 9bps (exception being Russell's IWF at 18bps), so wtf is Invesco doing wasting our time and killing all these trees to come to us with a pitiful 2bps reduction to 18?! Seriously, I almost voted ""Against"" because it's so freaking insulting Invesco blew so much money on this campaign just to treat us like idiots. 

source from Strategas Research Partners, 09/09/2025: [https://www.riskbridgeadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/qqq.png.webp](https://www.riskbridgeadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/qqq.png.webp)



**Voted Individually on Proposal 2:** Electing 9 individual Trustees to replace the current Trustee (a bank). Invesco auto-selected for us to vote ""For"" across the board. That really rubbed me the wrong way and I spent a good chunk of my time investing all the individual trustees to make my own selection. In a capitalist society, money is power and it's about dang time I use my hard earned muggle dollars to make however small an impact I possibly have. Below is how I selected for the Trustees, feel free to DM me for details or even better, research this yourself to make an informed decision:

Ronn R. Bagge: Withhold 

Todd J. Barre: For 

Brian Hartigan: For 

Victoria J. Herget: For 

Marc M. Kole: Withhold 

Yung Bong Lim: For 

Joanne Pace: For 

Gary R. Wicker: For 

Donald H. Wilson: Against



**Voted ""Against"" Proposal 3:** Invesco is proposing to serve as the Trust’s investment adviser. This for me is the kicker, if they want this to happen, come back to us with something better. I think this is how we can send the message ""Naw, don't insult us, work a little harder on this. Show us how much you want it."" I voted ""Against"" for Proposal 3 for all the reasons I explained above. I believe we shareholders can get a lot better deal and this is our chance to achieve it. If we blindly vote ""For"" on all three proposals, we've lost our voice and the Goliaths will have their chance to pull the strings behind the scenes while we get a pathetic 2bps reduction, which will be the **HIGHEST** fee of the large open-end ETFs.

2025-10-12 17:31:04,ETFs,Why I voted NO on the QQQ Proposal for Open End Fund,"This is very simple.  QQQ is not broken.  Invesco has not adequately explained to all of us why they are proposing this.  

1. This gives Invesco the ability control QQQ with any future changes they deem ""prudent"" to a board that will be next to impossible for us ""shareholders"" to change.  Average boardmember pay for 5 meetings a year will be about $400k for 8 trustees about $3M total.  See Links:  [https://funddirections.com/news/79155/invesco-plans-conversion-that-would-give-358b-etf-a-board-for-the-first-time/](https://funddirections.com/news/79155/invesco-plans-conversion-that-would-give-358b-etf-a-board-for-the-first-time/)and  [https://www.thompsonhine.com/insights/understanding-the-qqq-conversion-from-uit-to-open-end-etf/](https://www.thompsonhine.com/insights/understanding-the-qqq-conversion-from-uit-to-open-end-etf/)

2. The day this was announced, Invesco shares soared 15% the day this was announced because it also gives them the ability to not only recover marketing fees but also profit.  Estimates are that Invesco has the potential to reap $700 million in potential revenue.  (Link:  [https://www.investopedia.com/why-invesco-stock-is-soaring-after-proposing-this-change-to-qqq-etf-11775102](https://www.investopedia.com/why-invesco-stock-is-soaring-after-proposing-this-change-to-qqq-etf-11775102) .)  It is not explained how this arrangement benefits us.  Does the institutional trustee Bank of New York Mellon take the entire 0.02% management fee minus marketing as profit today?  This has not been adequately explained by Invesco how they are going to make more money and yet the ETF Shareholder wins ( Link:  [https://funddirections.com/news/79155/invesco-plans-conversion-that-would-give-358b-etf-a-board-for-the-first-time/](https://funddirections.com/news/79155/invesco-plans-conversion-that-would-give-358b-etf-a-board-for-the-first-time/) ).  

This is all upside for Invesco.  If this goes through, half joking, perhaps Invesco (IVZ) ends up being the better investment than QQQ ?  At any rate,  I did appreciate the emailed online voting instructions that allowed me to bypass the rude solicitors who hung up on me when I wouldn't commit to voting yes over the telephone.  I think that said it all.  The 3 calls per day I hope now end (holdings in 3 differenct accounts).

New investor here, I’d really appreciate some feedback on my current ETF portfolio. My main goal was to keep things fairly diversified and on the safer side, but I’m not sure if my allocations make sense given my short time horizon, I might need to use this money in about 2 years.

I deposit 2k each month as follows:

VTI	 —> 25%
BND —> 25%
VIG	 —> 10%
IEFA —> 10%
QQQ —> 10%
IJH —> 5%
IEMG —> 5%
gld	—> 5%
cash —> 5% (last 2 months I put cash in gld instead)

Would love to hear your thoughts on:

Whether the risk level fits a 2-year window
Any ETFs you think are redundant or too risky for that timeframe
Suggestions on how to tweak it.

Thanks in advance for any advice",3,7,0.8,https://reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1o2bujq/etf_portfolio_advice/,0.048,0.864,0.089,0.8049

[https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/proxy-vote-information.html](https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/proxy-vote-information.html), but I see nothing about the downside. So, why would anyone not want to do it? Why do we even have to vote if it makes so much sense?",7,2,0.77,https://reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1ny6gf5/qqq_restructure/,0.056,0.907,0.036,0.1373
